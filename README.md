# Interactive SVG Image

## Background

This kata is inspired by a real world project, where the aim is to create an interactive bridge between the 
Android Framework and the app's WebView using JavaScript.

The full project description can be found [here][1]. 

## Description

The scope of this kata will be limited to writing a JavaScript functionality that will allow users to interact with our 
map in the format of an `SVG` file.

We will need to make the `SVG` file interactive:

- be able to select one state of the map at a time
- display that a state has been selected (or tapped), by changing its colour (or its border's colour for example)
- draw a circle on top of the selected state
- keep the state selected if it's tapped multiple times
- get and display the information of the state when it's tapped.
